=== Custom Button Shortcode ===

== Description ==

This plugin adds a download button in the TinyMCE toolbar which opens a popup with a few options for styling the button and also a link to the WP Media Library so you can choose a file to link to it. 

My intention is not publishing this plugin, this is only a source of study for those who could be stuck in the same problems I had, such as the terrible TinyMCE Documentation. Most of the information I got was due to a lot of digging and researching. See some of my references below.

I know my code is not the best organized and probably could use a few improvements but as I said it is not meant to be published it is only a source of study for those who need!! As I did!! 

== Installation ==

= Install =

1. Unzip the file
2. Copy the plgtv_theme_shortcodes folder into the plugins folder
3. Activate the plugin
4. In the Admin area open any page / post with the text Editor and you will see the new button. Dont forget to open the kitchen sink (the last button in the 1st toolbar) as the button will be added to the 3rd toolbar

If you find any bugs or have any ideas, please mail me. I will be more than glad to hear from you!!

= Requirements =
